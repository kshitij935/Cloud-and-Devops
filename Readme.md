# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

A **command-line calculator application** built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.  
This project is designed for beginners learning Python programming and helps understand **functions, loops, conditionals**, and **user input handling**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates:
- The use of **functions** to organize code.
- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for logic flow.
- **While loops** for repeated execution.
- **Input validation** and **error handling** (like division by zero).
  
It’s a great foundational project to practice Python basics while building something practical and interactive.
